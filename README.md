## evo-scad

`shopenscad.sh` is a script that works idiosyncratically on my i3 setup assuming an openscad window is open to the right that runs automatically when running `py openscad_gen.py`

this is a weekend project, for fun, and the code is awful. i'd like to come back to this sometime and maybe use an existing pretrained model to get some actually good latents for my code, instead of algorithmic mutation.
